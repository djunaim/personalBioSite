    <!-- TODO: Fill in bio info here: What is your background? Why do you want to go into development? What do you love about development? -->
    <p>Background: After getting my B.A. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I wanted to travel and see the world for what it is in its whole form, and not just a molecule. After a fun year and a half in Korea, I worked at Vanderbilt as a program coordinator for clinical research within the Cardiac Surgery Department. From there, I have been in clinical research ever since, whether that was in the hospital or the CRO level, and now, working at a health tech startup that is changing the way clinical trials are run.</p>
    <p>Why development: Merging my 2 experiences of clinical trias and now tech, I want to bridge the gap between technology and clinical research.</p>
    <p>Fun thing about development: Instant gratification. Being able to see what you've done to *hopefully* display on the page is really nice when everything goes according to plan.</p>
